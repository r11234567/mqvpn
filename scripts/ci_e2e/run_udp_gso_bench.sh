# run_udp_gso_bench.sh — UdpGso / UdpGro A/B/C/D benchmark: throughput,
# CPU cost, receive-side counters, and latency
#
# Measures the win (or lack of one) from `udp_gso` (Linux TX UDP GSO /
# batched-send registration — see src/udp_offload.{c,h}, wired in
# init_xquic_engine() in mqvpn_client.c / mqvpn_server.c) and `udp_gro`
# (Linux RX UDP GRO / recvmsg-based coalesced-datagram splitting — see
# mqvpn_udp_gro_enable(), wired in the client's path-registration loop and
# the server's svr_create_udp_socket() in src/platform/linux/platform_linux.c) on
# the SAME binary, so every comparison is purely a runtime UdpGso/UdpGro
# toggle and never a rebuild artifact (G20 — see mqvpn-dev-gates skill:
# compiler/flag drift between arms has produced false conclusions before).
# The binary path and its sha256 are recorded in the output header for
# that reason.
#
# Arms (single client/server pair, same 2-path netns topology as
# run_udp_gso_config_test.sh, fresh netns/PSK/cert every run) — four
# arms, the full 2x2 of the two independent knobs:
#   A. "default"   — no --config / -C. udp_gso and udp_gro both default to
#      true in src/config.c's mqvpn_config_defaults(). (udp_gso also has a
#      library-side default in src/mqvpn_config.c because it crosses the
#      public ABI; udp_gro is platform-only and has none — do not look for
#      one there.)
#   B. "disabled"  — [Advanced]/UdpGso=false via -C <ini>, udp_gro stays
#      default true. INI content mirrors run_udp_gso_config_test.sh's
#      Arm B exactly (== tests/test_config.c's test_advanced_udp_gso
#      fixture).
#   C. "gro_off"   — [Advanced]/UdpGro=false via -C <ini>, udp_gso stays
#      default true. Mirrors run_udp_gso_config_test.sh's Arm C exactly
#      (== tests/test_config.c's test_advanced_udp_gro fixture).
#   D. "both_off"  — [Advanced]/UdpGso=false AND UdpGro=false via -C
#      <ini> — the true pre-#167 baseline (neither offload wired at all).
# All four arms pass -C to BOTH endpoints (empty extra_flags for arm A).
# Per run we also grep both endpoints' logs for the "udp-gso: " AND
# "udp-gro: " markers (pinned wording: the MQVPN_UDP_GSO_MARKER_* strings
# in mqvpn_conn_settings.h, platform_linux.c's mqvpn_udp_gro_enable() call
# sites, and run_udp_gso_config_test.sh's header comment) so the printed
# table proves which code path actually ran in each row for BOTH knobs,
# not just which flags were passed.
#
# Per run:
#   - iperf3 TCP, client (NS_CLIENT) -> server (NS_SERVER) upload, no -R.
#     This is the same direction/idiom as bench_aggregate.sh /
#     run_throughput_floor_test.sh (iperf3 -c ... -t DURATION -P STREAMS
#     --json, parsed via python3 for end.sum_received / end.sum). Upload
#     (not -R/download) is deliberate: it drives data from the CLIENT's TUN
#     out through the CLIENT's outer UDP TX path (what UdpGso batches) and
#     back in through the SERVER's outer UDP RX path (what UdpGro
#     coalesces) — the same direction exercises both knobs' receive side.
#   - CPU: both mqvpn processes (client + server, PIDs tracked by
#     bench_env_setup.sh as $_BENCH_CLIENT_PID / $_BENCH_SERVER_PID) are
#     sampled for the same window as the iperf3 transfer.
#     No bench sibling in this repo uses pidstat (grepped; all CPU/RSS
#     sampling in this tree is /proc-based, e.g.
#     scripts/ci_stress/ci_stress_env.sh:290-312's RSS monitor), so this
#     script prefers pidstat when present (verified empirically against the
#     real /usr/bin/pidstat on a dev box — see comment above
#     proc_cpu_ticks() below for exactly what was checked) and falls back
#     to a plain /proc/[pid]/stat utime+stime delta otherwise. Either
#     method reports whole-process CPU (all threads aggregated), confirmed
#     empirically with a 2-thread pthread busy-loop test process reading
#     ~200% from both methods — not just the main thread.
#   - Transmit-side counters (per run, printed as a separate detail table —
#     see the "Transmit-side detail" section below): the "udp-tx: sends=N
#     datagrams=M gso_config=X" teardown telemetry line from BOTH endpoint
#     logs, parsed under the same reaped-first / "NA" rules as the
#     receive-side line below. datagrams/sends is the achieved batching
#     factor, and the only runtime evidence that UdpGso did anything: the
#     startup "udp-gso: " marker reports a kernel capability probe, so it
#     reads identically whether every burst formed a 32-datagram GSO run or
#     every datagram took a syscall of its own.
#   - Receive-side counters (per run, printed as a separate detail table —
#     see the "Receive-side detail" section below): the "udp-rx:
#     receives=N datagrams=M gro_config=X" teardown telemetry line from
#     BOTH endpoint logs (parsed only after the process has been reaped —
#     it is written at teardown, so it does not exist while the process is
#     alive; a missing line means the arm failed before carrying traffic,
#     recorded as "NA" fields, not treated as a parse error);
#     Udp: InErrors / RcvbufErrors from /proc/net/snmp in each namespace,
#     sampled before and after the traffic window and reported as a
#     before/after delta column (bulk UDP through netns can legitimately
#     drop in any arm — this is diagnostic context for the maintainer's
#     reading of the throughput number, never a pass/fail gate); and the
#     effective SO_RCVBUF per endpoint (`ss -uln -m` in the namespace,
#     max "rb" value seen) — the client requests 7 MiB
#     (src/mqvpn_client.c's SOCKET_BUF_SIZE) and the server 1 MiB
#     (src/platform/linux/platform_linux.c), both unchecked, and Linux
#     clamps to rmem_max unless SO_RCVBUFFORCE succeeds, so the effective
#     value can be far smaller than the source suggests.
#   - Latency under load (arms "default" and "gro_off" ONLY — the kernel
#     only coalesces packets that arrive in the same NAPI poll and
#     gro_flush_timeout is 0 by default, so on an idle tunnel GRO and
#     non-GRO are identical by construction and a low-rate arm would
#     compare nothing; only these two arms isolate the UdpGro toggle under
#     real load): `ping` runs concurrently with the iperf3
#     window and its `rtt min/avg/max/mdev` summary is recorded, compacted
#     into one slash-delimited token (min/avg/max/mdev, no spaces) for the
#     row format — the raw ping output is preserved at
#     ${LOG_DIR}/ping_<tag>.txt for the exact original line. Reported, not
#     gated: whether any latency delta is acceptable is the maintainer's
#     call, not this script's.
#   - N runs per arm (default 3), medians reported (throughput/CPU only —
#     the receive-side/latency numbers are diagnostic and printed per-run,
#     not medianed). Arms ALTERNATE (default, disabled, gro_off, both_off,
#     default, disabled, gro_off, both_off, ...) rather than running all of
#     one arm then all of the next, to spread any monotonic drift (thermal
#     throttling, netns/cert-gen warmup, etc.) evenly across all four arms
#     instead of biasing whichever pair runs last.
#
# Output: a compact per-run table + per-arm medians + a receive-side detail
# table, echoed to stdout AND appended to a file under ci_sweep_results/
# (gitignored, transient — see AGENTS.md: ci_sweep_results/ is transient,
# bench_results/ is the curated archive; this script deliberately does NOT
# write bench_results/).
#
# REQUIRES: root (netns + TUN), iperf3, python3, openssl (cert generation
# via bench_env_setup.sh's bench_start_vpn_server), ping. pidstat (sysstat)
# is OPTIONAL — auto-detected, falls back to /proc if absent.
#
# This is a local maintainer tool, NOT wired into CI (no ci.yml/stress.yml
# reference). It is not a throughput/CPU pass/fail gate — a completed
# comparison always prints its table regardless of the numbers — but it
# DOES exit nonzero (after printing the table) if: a sanitizer error fired
# in any run, EITHER the "udp-gso: " or "udp-gro: " marker didn't match
# the expected present/absent state for its arm in any run (a
# silently-void A/B produced a plausible-looking table once already — see
# MARKER_FAIL below), or every run failed and there is nothing to report.
#
# --- Optional shaped mode (UDP_GSO_BENCH_NETEM=1) ---
# An unshaped netns never blocks a send: cwnd/pacing never bites, so
# write_mmsg_ex is only ever called with vlen==1 and GSO measures as
# neutral (or worse, due to per-call cmsg overhead with nothing to
# amortize it over). Real links block: with RTT + a rate cap, cwnd/pacing
# queues datagrams and ACK-clocked bursts hand write_mmsg_ex real vlen>1
# batches, which is the only regime GSO can show a win in. Setting
# UDP_GSO_BENCH_NETEM=1 applies tc netem (delay NETEM_DELAY, rate
# NETEM_RATE — same profile on both paths, both directions) via
# bench_env_setup.sh's bench_apply_netem, following the same shape/ordering
# precedent as run_throughput_floor_test.sh:187-191 and
# bench_env_setup.sh:254-274's bench_apply_netem itself. A single
# invocation is either fully shaped or fully unshaped — never mixed, so
# the printed table stays a single-condition comparison (the unshaped
# numbers already exist from prior runs). With the link saturated by
# iperf3, CPU is no longer pinned near 100%; the meaningful comparison
# becomes CPU% at equal throughput between arms, not raw throughput.
#
# Usage:
#   sudo bash scripts/ci_e2e/run_udp_gso_bench.sh [path/to/mqvpn] [duration_s] [runs]
# Defaults: path/to/mqvpn = build/mqvpn (repo-relative), duration_s = 10,
#           runs = 3 (per arm; 4*runs total launches, alternating over the
#           four arms).
# Env override: IPERF_STREAMS (default 4) — iperf3 -P parallel stream count.
# Env override: UDP_GSO_BENCH_NETEM (default 0) — set to 1 to shape both
#           paths with tc netem instead of running on the bare netns.
# Env override: NETEM_DELAY (default 20ms), NETEM_RATE (default 300mbit) —
#           only consulted when UDP_GSO_BENCH_NETEM=1.

# --- CPU measurement helpers ---
#
# Verified empirically on the dev box preparing this script (real
# /usr/bin/pidstat from sysstat, not from memory — sysstat's column set
# has changed across versions historically, so this was checked live):
#   - `LC_ALL=C S_TIME_FORMAT=ISO pidstat -p PID 1 N`'s "Average:" line has
#     the shape `Average:  UID  PID  %usr  %system  %guest  %wait  %CPU
#     CPU(-)  Command` — %CPU is field 8 (awk $8). Confirmed against a
#     busy-loop test process (100.00 for a fully CPU-bound single thread).
#   - S_TIME_FORMAT=ISO avoids a real footgun: pidstat's default per-sample
#     timestamp is locale-dependent 12h "HH:MM:SS AM/PM" (adds an extra
#     field vs. 24h), which would shift every awk column index on the
#     *timestamped* lines. This script only ever parses the "Average:"
#     line, which has no timestamp field and is therefore immune to that
#     shift either way — S_TIME_FORMAT=ISO is set anyway so the raw
#     per-sample files left in $LOG_DIR are readable un-ambiguously if a
#     maintainer tails them by hand.
#   - Both pidstat and /proc/[pid]/stat aggregate ALL threads of a PID into
#     one figure, not just the main thread — confirmed with a 2-thread
#     pthread busy-loop process reading ~200.00% from both methods. (A
#     naive assumption that /proc/PID/stat is "just the main thread" would
#     have been wrong and would have undercounted a multi-threaded mqvpn.)
