# run_udp_gso_config_test.sh — E2E test for the [Advanced] UdpGso and
# UdpGro config keys. Filename kept as `udp_gso` on purpose even though
# it now covers both offload knobs: .github/workflows/ci.yml:385 and
# several bench-script comments reference this path, and a rename would
# spread diff noise for no functional gain.
#
# `udp_gso` (Linux TX UDP GSO / batched-send registration, see
# src/udp_offload.{c,h} and the wiring in mqvpn_client.c / mqvpn_server.c's
# init_xquic_engine()) and `udp_gro` (Linux RX UDP GRO / recvmsg-based
# coalesced-datagram splitting, see mqvpn_udp_gro_enable() called from the
# client's path-registration loop and the server's svr_create_udp_socket() in
# src/platform/linux/platform_linux.c) both have NO CLI flag — the
# [Advanced] section of the INI config file is their only input surface
# (src/config.c's CFG_BOOL(SEC_ADVANCED, "UdpGso", "udp_gso", udp_gso) /
# CFG_BOOL(SEC_ADVANCED, "UdpGro", "udp_gro", udp_gro); both default to 1 in
# src/config.c's mqvpn_config_defaults(). udp_gso additionally has a
# library-side default in src/mqvpn_config.c because it crosses the public
# ABI — udp_gro deliberately has no library-side presence at all, so do not
# go looking for one there). This
# mirrors run_reinjection_test.sh's rationale comment for the same reason
# ([Multipath] Reinjection is also config-file-only).
#
# G13 note — log wording is an observable invariant, pinned here for
# UdpGso and extended to UdpGro in the same spirit: this script greps
# both endpoints' startup logs for two disjoint literal prefixes:
#     LOG_I(x, "%s", ...gso_available ? MQVPN_UDP_GSO_MARKER_ENABLED
#                                     : MQVPN_UDP_GSO_MARKER_UNAVAILABLE);
#         (both endpoints; strings defined once in mqvpn_conn_settings.h:
#          "udp-gso: GSO enabled" / "udp-gso: GSO unavailable, using sendmmsg")
#     LOG_INF("udp-gro: enabled on path[%d]", i);      /* client, per path */
#     LOG_INF("udp-gro: unavailable on path[%d] (%s); ...", i, ...);
#     LOG_INF("udp-gro: enabled");                     /* server */
#     LOG_INF("udp-gro: unavailable (%s); ...", ...);
# Changing either wording, or moving/removing any of these call sites,
# silently breaks the corresponding assertions below (presence in the arm
# where that knob is on, absence in the arm where it is forced off) the
# same way the "reconnecting in" / "stuck in PENDING" wordings are pinned
# invariants elsewhere in this suite (see sanitizer_check.sh and
# AGENTS.md's e2e log marker note). If you reword either, update the
# matching grep pattern in this file (search "udp-gso:" / "udp-gro:") in
# the same change. Two teardown telemetry lines use further, disjoint
# prefixes that never match either grep above (formats defined once as
# UDP_RX_LINE_FMT in platform_linux.c and MQVPN_UDP_TX_LINE_FMT in
# mqvpn_internal.h):
#     "udp-rx: receives=%llu datagrams=%llu gro_config=%d"
#     "udp-tx: sends=%llu datagrams=%llu gso_config=%d"   (client and server)
# Both are emitted unconditionally — on the enabled and the disabled path
# alike — so a knob's state shows up in the *_config field value rather
# than in the line's presence, and neither can serve as an enablement
# marker. They are asserted by check_teardown_line below, which runs after
# the endpoints have been reaped (the lines do not exist before teardown:
# udp-rx comes from platform_linux.c's `cleanup:` labels, udp-tx from
# mqvpn_client_destroy / mqvpn_server_destroy). run_udp_gso_bench.sh
# parses the same two lines into its result table.
#
# Race-freedom rationale (why asserting log-ABSENCE right after tunnel-up
# is safe, not a best-effort poll): both LOG_I("udp-gso: ...") call sites
# run inside init_xquic_engine(), synchronously before xqc_engine_create()
# — i.e. strictly before the engine exists, and therefore strictly before
# any handshake can begin. The udp-gro markers run even earlier in the
# startup sequence: the client's fires per path inside the socket
# registration loop, strictly before mqvpn_client_connect() is called;
# the server's fires inside svr_create_udp_socket(), strictly before
# event_base_dispatch() is reached. "Tunnel is up" (first successful
# tunnel ping) can only happen after a completed handshake, which
# happens-after engine creation and after the event loop starts running —
# both of which happen-after every point above where a marker would have
# been emitted had its knob been on. So by the time the tunnel-ping check
# below passes, there is no remaining window where either marker could
# still be about to appear — checking the log files at that point is
# equivalent to checking them at any later time.
#
# Arms (single client/server pair per arm; fresh netns + fresh PSK/cert
# each time via bench_env_setup.sh). Each arm asserts BOTH markers'
# present/absent state — checking only the knob under test would let a
# regression in the OTHER knob's wiring pass silently:
#   A. default (UdpGso=true, UdpGro=true) — no --config / -C. The
#      "udp-gso: " line (either "GSO enabled" or "GSO unavailable, using
#      sendmmsg" — both prove the batch send path was registered; the
#      choice between them depends on the CI runner's kernel, which this
#      test does not pin) and the "udp-gro: " line (either "enabled" or
#      "unavailable...", same kernel-dependence caveat) MUST both be
#      present in BOTH the client and server logs.
#   B. UdpGso=false (-C), UdpGro stays default true — a minimal INI
#      containing ONLY [Advanced] / UdpGso = false is passed via -C to
#      BOTH endpoints, same flags as Arm A otherwise. The "udp-gso: " line
#      MUST be ABSENT from both logs (proves the escape hatch cleanly
#      restores the legacy per-packet xqc_engine_create() registration
#      with no GSO callback wired in at all — not merely "GSO available
#      but declined"); the "udp-gro: " line MUST still be PRESENT (UdpGro
#      is untouched by this arm).
#   C. UdpGro=false (-C), UdpGso stays default true — a minimal INI
#      containing ONLY [Advanced] / UdpGro = false is passed via -C to
#      BOTH endpoints. The "udp-gro: " line MUST be ABSENT from both logs
#      (proves the escape hatch cleanly restores the legacy
#      one-datagram-per-recvmsg() path with no GRO sockopt set at all);
#      the "udp-gso: " line MUST still be PRESENT (UdpGso is untouched by
#      this arm).
#
# All arms verify tunnel connectivity (ping through the tunnel) after
# the marker checks, same idiom as every other 2-path e2e script in this
