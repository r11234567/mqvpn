# Windows Build Guide (MSVC x64)

How to build the mqvpn client on Windows using MSVC.

> **Note:** Only the client is supported on Windows. The server is Linux-only.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Purpose | Install |
|------|---------|---------|
| Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools | C/C++ compiler (MSVC) | `winget install Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools` (select C++ workload) |
| CMake >= 3.10 | Build system | `winget install Kitware.CMake` |
| Go | Required by BoringSSL | `winget install GoLang.Go` |
| NASM | Required by BoringSSL (assembly) | `winget install NASM.NASM` |
| Perl (Strawberry Perl) | Required by BoringSSL | `winget install StrawberryPerl.StrawberryPerl` |
| vcpkg | Install libevent | `git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg && .\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat` |
| Git | Source checkout | `winget install Git.Git` |

### Wintun

The TUN device is provided by [Wintun](https://www.wintun.net/). `wintun.dll` is a **required runtime dependency** on Windows.

You must install/provide `wintun.dll` before running mqvpn:

1. Download the official Wintun release package from the Wintun website.
2. Extract it and copy the x64 `wintun.dll` to the mqvpn executable directory (for example, `build\Release\`), or place it in a directory included in `PATH`.
3. Verify it is discoverable (`build\Release\wintun.dll` exists, or `where wintun.dll` resolves it).

`wintun.dll` is loaded dynamically at runtime, so build succeeds without it, but mqvpn client startup fails if it is missing.

## Build Steps

Run all commands from a Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022, or source `vcvars64.bat` first:

```
call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"
```

### 1. Install libevent

```
vcpkg install libevent:x64-windows-static
```

### 2. Build BoringSSL

```
REM BoringSSL is a submodule of the xquic fork (pinned); it is fetched by
REM `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
cd third_party\xquic\third_party\boringssl

mkdir build && cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=0 ..
cmake --build . --target ssl --config Release
cmake --build . --target crypto --config Release
```

### 3. Build xquic

```
cd third_party\xquic
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 ^
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ^
  -DSSL_TYPE=boringssl ^
  -DSSL_PATH=%cd%\..\..\xquic\third_party\boringssl ^
  -DXQC_ENABLE_BBR2=ON ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

### 4. Build mqvpn

Replace `VCPKG_ROOT` with the path to your vcpkg clone.

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 ^
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ^
  -DXQUIC_BUILD_DIR=..\third_party\xquic\build\Release ^
  -DBORINGSSL_BUILD_DIR=..\third_party\xquic\third_party\boringssl\build\Release ^
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=%VCPKG_ROOT%\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake ^
  -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows-static ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

On success, the binary is at `build\Release\mqvpn.exe`.

## Usage Examples

On Windows, `--path` is required (one or more). Pass the adapter
**FriendlyName** as shown in `Get-NetAdapter` (PowerShell) or `ncpa.cpl`,
e.g. `Ethernet`, `Wi-Fi`, `イーサネット 3`. Quote names that contain
spaces.

```powershell
Get-NetAdapter | Where-Object Status -eq 'Up' | Select Name, InterfaceDescription
```

Single path:

```
mqvpn.exe --mode client --server 203.0.113.1:443 --auth-key <key> ^
  --path "Ethernet"
```

Multipath (multiple NICs):

```
mqvpn.exe --mode client --server 203.0.113.1:443 --auth-key <key> ^
  --path "Ethernet" --path "Ethernet 3" --scheduler wlb
```

## Console output encoding

Log messages contain ASCII only, deliberately, and
`scripts/lint/check_log_string_ascii.py` fails CI if a non-ASCII character
appears inside a C string literal. Comments are exempt — they never reach a
console.

The reason is that the Windows console decodes bytes with the system ANSI
codepage, which is CP936 on a Simplified Chinese install, while the sources are
UTF-8. A `→` written in a log message is emitted as its three UTF-8 bytes
`E2 86 92`; CP936 reads `E2 86` as one hanzi and cannot pair the remaining
`92`, so it prints as a stray character. That is what produced

```
TUN mqvpn0 addr: 10.203.0.10 鈫?10.203.0.1 /32
```

Adapter names are not affected, because they arrive from Win32 already encoded
in the console's codepage — which is why a single log line could show a correct
`以太网 4` beside a corrupted `→`. Two encodings, one line.

`SetConsoleOutputCP(CP_UTF8)` was considered and rejected: it fixes the console
and nothing else. Logs are also redirected to files, captured by a GUI, and
read by other tools, and each of those picks an encoding for itself. Staying
inside ASCII is the only form that is correct for every consumer, so write
`->` and `--` rather than `→` and `—`.

See `docs/logging.md` for the rest of the log conventions, including what the
levels mean and how a path is identified across lines.
