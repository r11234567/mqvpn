 *     error is a plain hard error and never sticky-disables GSO.
 *   - otherwise: one sendmmsg for the whole batch.
 *   - Any failure after >= 1 datagram sent: return the cumulative count

 * MQVPN_OFFLOAD_MAX_BATCH (32) packets x 1400B = 44,800B, comfortably under
 * both the ~64KB kernel GSO/UDP ceiling and UDP_MAX_SEGMENTS (64) — cnt is
 * capped at MQVPN_OFFLOAD_MAX_BATCH (== XQC_MAX_SEND_MSG_ONCE). This module
 * never itself checks MQVPN_MAX_PKT_OUT_SIZE: the write_mmsg_ex registration
 * (mqvpn_tx_batch_register in mqvpn_conn_settings.c) already guards
 * entry to this whole batching path on MQVPN_MAX_PKT_OUT_SIZE <= 1500, so a
 * full run cannot approach the 64KB ceiling today. Run splitting inside this
 * module would only become necessary if that registration guard were lifted
 * (MQVPN_MAX_PKT_OUT_SIZE raised above ~2KB without adding splitting here
 * first) — otherwise a full run could exceed 64KB and fail EMSGSIZE, which
 * classifies as GSO-class and would permanently (and misleadingly)
 * sticky-disable GSO on that socket. */
