 * control_socket.h — TCP control API for mqvpn server
 *
 * Listens on a TCP port (default: 127.0.0.1 only) and accepts JSON commands.
 * All I/O is driven by the same libevent loop as the VPN — no locking needed.
 *
 * Protocol: one JSON object per connection (newline-terminated or EOF).
 * Response: one JSON object followed by a newline, then connection closes.
 *
 * Example:
 *   echo '{"cmd":"add_user","name":"carol","key":"carol-secret"}' \
 *       | nc 127.0.0.1 9090
