mqvpn is an open-source VPN that combines multiple internet connections—such as Wi-Fi, cellular, Starlink, and multiple ISPs—for bandwidth aggregation and seamless failover.

Example: an 8 Mbps SRT live stream over two 6 Mbit uplinks — a single connection (left) vs the same two connections bonded by mqvpn (right):

## Differences from upstream

This repository is a fork of [mp0rta/mqvpn](https://github.com/mp0rta/mqvpn).
Relative to upstream it adds a real client-side certificate check, SNI-based
shared-port routing on the server, and post-quantum key exchange — plus the
transport fixes those changes turned out to need before the end-to-end suite
would pass. The transport fixes live in the pinned
[xquic fork](https://github.com/r11234567/xquic), not in this tree.

### Client certificate verification against the OS trust store

Upstream hands the decision to xquic/BoringSSL and collapses it into one flag:
`cb_cert_verify` returns success when `--insecure` is set and failure otherwise,
building no chain and checking no hostname of its own. This fork verifies the
chain itself in `src/cert_verify.c`, against the platform's own trust store:

- **Windows** — `CertGetCertificateChain` and
  `CertVerifyCertificateChainPolicy(CERT_CHAIN_POLICY_SSL)` against the native
  certificate store (linked via `crypt32`).
- **Android** — the framework's own `X509TrustManager`, reached through
  `mqvpn_set_cert_trust_check`. Nothing else works there: Android's CA store is
  at none of the paths BoringSSL compiles in, it moved into an updatable APEX in
  Android 14, and user-installed CAs are only reachable through the framework.
- **Other POSIX** — the default CA paths of the bundled OpenSSL-compatible X.509
  implementation. Packagers must make those paths resolvable on the target.

Every path checks expiry, chaining to a trusted root, and that the certificate
identity matches the hostname, and every one reports *why* a handshake was
refused rather than failing opaquely. Verification is on by default, and
`--insecure` is an explicit opt-out that logs a warning for as long as it is
active.

The identity check is shared rather than per-platform, so all of them agree on
which names a certificate may speak for. An IP literal is matched against the
certificate's `iPAddress` SANs, and a DNS name against its `dNSName` SANs; the
deprecated commonName is never accepted as an identity.

```ini
# /etc/mqvpn/client.conf
[Server]
Address    = 203.0.113.10:443
ServerName = vpn.example.com   # TLS SNI, and the name the certificate is checked
                               # against (default: the host part of Address)
# Insecure = true              # skip verification entirely — testing only
```

`ServerName` (CLI: `--tls-server-name`) is the setting to reach for when
connecting to a bare IP that presents a **DNS** certificate: without it the IP
literal is what gets matched, and a certificate naming only DNS hosts does not
match it. A certificate issued *for the address* needs no `ServerName`. Full
details, and the procedure for preserving this while merging upstream releases,
are in
[docs/client-certificate-verification.md](docs/client-certificate-verification.md).

### Server fallback proxy — share one UDP port with another QUIC service

On Linux the mqvpn listener can front a second QUIC service on the same port.
The router reads the SNI out of QUIC v1/v2 Initial packets **without terminating
the fallback connection's TLS**: configured names stay in mqvpn, ordinary HTTP/3
goes to an h2c backend, and anything unmatched is forwarded as raw UDP.

```ini
# /etc/mqvpn/server.conf — Linux only, disabled by default
[Proxy]
Enabled         = true
SNI             = vpn.example.com,*.edge.example  # names that stay in mqvpn
QuicFallback    = 127.0.0.1:4443                  # unmatched SNI, raw UDP
Http2Backend    = 127.0.0.1:8080                  # prior-knowledge h2c
Http2BackendTLS = false                           # true is rejected on purpose
MaxConnections  = 64
IdleTimeoutSec  = 60
```

Both backends are required for the feature to start. `Http2BackendTLS = true` is
rejected deliberately rather than ignored. See
[docs/server-fallback-proxy.md](docs/server-fallback-proxy.md) for the routing
rules, an nginx example, the security properties, and the current limitations.

### Post-quantum key exchange (X25519MLKEM768)

Both ends request hybrid ML-KEM-768 by default. It is compiled in rather than
exposed as a config key; these two lines are identical in `src/mqvpn_client.c`
and `src/mqvpn_server.c`:

```c
/* Prioritize AES-256-GCM for stronger encryption */
engine_ssl.ciphers =
    "TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384:TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256:TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256";
/* Enable post-quantum key exchange with X25519MLKEM768 */
engine_ssl.groups = "X25519MLKEM768:X25519:P-256:P-384:P-521";
```

ML-KEM-768 is listed first with the classical curves behind it, so a peer that
does not offer it still negotiates X25519 — turning this on does not cut off
older clients or servers.

ML-KEM-768's 1184-byte key share breaks assumptions the transport was built on,
so it needs these supporting settings to work at all:

| Setting | Value | Where |
|---|---|---|
| `enable_pmtud` | `1` | `src/mqvpn_conn_settings.c:131` |
| `MQVPN_MAX_PKT_OUT_SIZE` | `1400` | `src/mqvpn_internal.h:40` |
| `XQC_QUIC_MIN_MSS` / `XQC_QUIC_MAX_MSS` | `1200` / `1420` | xquic `src/transport/xqc_packet.h` |
| `XQC_PACKET_OUT_HDR_GROWTH` | 277-byte reserve | xquic `src/transport/xqc_packet_out.h` |

The MSS pair is back at upstream's numbers on purpose. Raising
`XQC_QUIC_MIN_MSS` to 1500 was the first attempt at making the PQC handshake fit
([6322682](https://github.com/r11234567/xquic/commit/6322682)); it was reverted
in favour of PMTUD plus the header reserve
([987c57c](https://github.com/r11234567/xquic/commit/987c57c)), which is the
combination that actually works and does not assume a 1500-byte path. One
residual limitation remains — see [Known issues](#known-issues).

### Multipath MTU: a narrow path used to black hole

Symptom, from a two-path run on an ordinary laptop — WiFi plus a handset
tethered over USB:

- adding the second path made throughput *worse* than either path alone;
- availability tracked the WiFi link exactly. Pulling WiFi stalled the tunnel
  for three minutes even though the tethered path stayed `ACTIVE` the whole
  time, and it only recovered when WiFi came back.

The cause was in xquic, and it is visible in the log as a packet size that
moves in one direction only:

```
20:10:34 [INF] [conn:1] datagram MSS updated: 1384     <- one path up
20:10:35 [INF] [conn:1] datagram MSS updated: 1404     <- second path up, MSS RISES
20:10:35 [INF] TUN MTU updated to 1402
```

A second path joining a connection can only ever *lower* the size every path
has to carry, never raise it. It rose because `conn->pkt_out_size` was
monotonically non-decreasing: the cross-path minimum was applied only when it
came out larger than the current value, a new path was seeded from the
connection's size rather than the size QUIC guarantees, and the PMTU search
could not probe below the value already in use. Details and the fix are in the
[xquic README](https://github.com/r11234567/xquic#per-path-pmtu-discovery).

`MQVPN_MAX_PKT_OUT_SIZE` is 1400, which is 1428 bytes on the wire once IPv4 and
UDP headers are on the datagram. Any link whose MTU is below that — 1400 is the
common case for tethered cellular — received packets it could not forward, and
every drop reached congestion control as congestion rather than as "too big".
Because the size had been raised while the wide path was up, the surviving
narrow path could carry only ACKs and other small packets after failover, which
is why availability followed WiFi: the connection was sized for a link that was
no longer there.

The fix makes the PMTU search per path, starts a new path at the guaranteed
size, and recomputes the connection's size in both directions — so losing a
path now gives the size back instead of stranding the connection above what it
can send. This repo needed no change to consume it: `cb_dgram_mss_updated`
already reacts to any change in the MSS, so the TUN MTU follows a decrease as
readily as an increase.

Two caveats. Adding a path now causes a brief dip while the new path confirms
its size, which is the price of one buffer size serving every path. And nothing
here is backed by a throughput measurement yet — the change is static analysis
plus unit tests, so read a weekly netsim run before believing the aggregation
numbers moved.

### End-to-end fixes carried in the pinned xquic

`third_party/xquic` is pinned at
[`55de779`](https://github.com/r11234567/xquic/commit/55de779). Enabling the
features above exposed transport bugs that the e2e suite caught and that had to
be fixed in xquic rather than here:

| xquic commit | What it fixes |
|---|---|
| [55de779](https://github.com/r11234567/xquic/commit/55de779) | **A path's packet size could only go up, so the narrower path black-holed.** See [Multipath MTU](#multipath-mtu-a-narrow-path-used-to-black-hole) below — this is the one that made a second path cost throughput instead of adding it. |
| [a40cbd5](https://github.com/r11234567/xquic/commit/a40cbd5) | **A Retry could not follow a full Initial.** `xqc_conn_reassemble_packet()` rebuilt the Initial with the Retry token in the header but copied the payload in verbatim, sized against the shorter header. With a PQC key share filling the packet, AEAD needed 1453 bytes of a 1452-byte buffer and encryption failed with `XQC_TLS_ENCRYPT_DATA_ERROR` (-736), so no handshake completed at all. Surfaced as a 10 s dispatch timeout in `tests/test_tcp_egress.c`. Fixed by reserving worst-case header growth; the payload copy is now bounds-checked too. |
| [513a991](https://github.com/r11234567/xquic/commit/513a991) | **A full receive buffer killed the connection.** Multipath bulk transfers died tens of MB in with `FRAME_ENCODING_ERROR`, traced to a buffered-frame cap of 8192 sitting *below* the 16 MiB receive window being advertised — a peer obeying flow control was rejected for exceeding a limit it was never told. Raised to `window/1KiB` and tied to the window by a `_Static_assert` so the two cannot drift apart again. |
| [2ae918c](https://github.com/r11234567/xquic/commit/2ae918c) | Hardens `xqc_var_buf_reduce` against a wrapping subtraction and casts both operands in `xqc_submatrix`, replacing the equivalent hunks this repo carried in `patches/xquic/`. |

On this side the matching work is in the netns e2e harness: the failover route
fix and diagnostics in `42eac6c`, and waiting on `closing_notify` rather than
`close_notify` in the TCP idle-eviction tests (`19f2e89`).

## Features

- **Multipath** — Bind multiple interfaces (WiFi + LTE, dual ISP). Seamless failover and bandwidth aggregation via WLB scheduler.
- **Standards-based** — the tunnel is MASQUE CONNECT-IP (RFC 9484) over Multipath QUIC. Optional extensions (hybrid TCP lane, reorder) are negotiated in-band; the wire stays standard when they are off.
- **Dual-stack** — IPv4 + IPv6 inside the tunnel.
- **Multi-Platform** — Available on Linux (server/client), Windows (client only), macOS (client only) and Android (client only) support.
- **PSK auth** — Pre-shared key over TLS 1.3.
- **Verified server identity** — Clients verify the server certificate chain and hostname by default; `--insecure` is an explicit testing-only bypass.
- **Shared-port fallback proxy** — A Linux server can route unmatched QUIC SNI to another QUIC service and proxy ordinary matched HTTP/3 requests to an h2c backend.
- **DNS override** — Prevents DNS leaks. Uses `resolvectl` on systemd-resolved systems, falls back to resolv.conf.


## Key Use Cases

**Stream bonding** — live feeds (SRT, RTMP) where a single connection does not provide sufficient bandwidth. The video at the top of this page shows an 8 Mbps SRT stream carried over two 6 Mbit uplinks; details in [Benchmarks](#benchmarks). RTMP, which cannot bond links on its own, bonds transparently through the tunnel — see [RTMP live streaming](#rtmp-live-streaming).

**Boosting general-purpose transfer** — not just video: bonding speeds up everyday traffic too. UDP and any other traffic is aggregated across paths over the datagram lane, and with [hybrid mode](#hybrid-mode-tcp-lane) TCP is aggregated as well — even a single TCP connection can use multiple paths at once. Details in [Benchmarks](#benchmarks).

**Staying connected on unreliable links** — when one connection drops or degrades (moving vehicles, congested Wi-Fi, cellular dead spots), traffic continues over the remaining paths without interrupting sessions.

## Installation

### Server

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/mp0rta/mqvpn/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sudo bash
```

This downloads the latest release, installs the binary, and generates a self-signed TLS certificate, auth key, and server config at `/etc/mqvpn/server.conf`. Add `--start` to start the server and register it for automatic startup on boot:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/mp0rta/mqvpn/releases/latest/download/install.sh \
    | sudo bash -s -- --start
```

> **Note:** The self-signed certificate requires `--insecure` on the client. For production, replace with a trusted certificate (e.g. Let's Encrypt) and omit `--insecure`.

Options can be combined:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/mp0rta/mqvpn/releases/latest/download/install.sh \
    | sudo bash -s -- --start --port 10020 --subnet 10.8.0.0/24
```

Uninstall: re-run the install script with `--uninstall`.
```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/mp0rta/mqvpn/releases/latest/download/install.sh \
    | sudo bash -s -- --uninstall
```

### Client (deb package)

Download the latest `.deb` from [Releases](https://github.com/mp0rta/mqvpn/releases/latest):

```bash
# Replace VERSION and ARCH as needed (e.g., 0.6.0, amd64)
curl -LO https://github.com/mp0rta/mqvpn/releases/latest/download/mqvpn_VERSION_ARCH.deb
sudo dpkg -i mqvpn_*.deb
```

### Windows client

Pre-built binaries are shipped for Windows amd64 and arm64. Download `mqvpn_<VERSION>_windows_<ARCH>.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/mp0rta/mqvpn/releases/latest), extract, and follow the bundled `README.txt` (admin PowerShell required).

### macOS client

Pre-built binaries are shipped for Apple silicon (arm64). Download `mqvpn_<VERSION>_darwin_arm64.tar.gz` from [Releases](https://github.com/mp0rta/mqvpn/releases/latest), extract, and follow the bundled `README.txt` (sudo required).

### Verifying downloads

Release artifacts carry [build provenance attestations](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/using-artifact-attestations)
signed via Sigstore. To verify a download was built by this repository's
release workflow:

```bash
gh attestation verify mqvpn_<VERSION>_<ARCH>.deb --owner mp0rta
```

A `SHA256SUMS` file is also attached to each release.

## Quick Start

After installing the server and client (see [Installation](#installation)):

```bash
# Client (single path)
sudo mqvpn --mode client --server YOUR_SERVER:443 \
    --auth-key YOUR_AUTH_KEY --insecure

# Client (multipath)
sudo mqvpn --mode client --server YOUR_SERVER:443 \
    --auth-key YOUR_AUTH_KEY --path eth0 --path wlan0 --insecure

# Client (with DNS override)
sudo mqvpn --mode client --server YOUR_SERVER:443 \
    --auth-key YOUR_AUTH_KEY --dns 1.1.1.1 --dns 8.8.8.8 --insecure
```

> **Notes:**
> - On Linux, without `--path`, the client uses the default interface (single path); multipath requires two or more `--path` flags. On Windows, `--path` is always required (one or more); see `docs/windows_build.md`.
> - The server needs its listen port open for UDP (default: 443). All client traffic is routed through the tunnel.

## Configuration

Config files support both INI and JSON. CLI arguments override config values.
### INI config

```ini
# /etc/mqvpn/server.conf
[Interface]
Listen = 0.0.0.0:443
Subnet = 10.0.0.0/24
Subnet6 = 2001:db8:1::/112
# MTU = 1280                   # TUN MTU (1280–9000, default: auto = ~1382)

[TLS]
Cert = /etc/mqvpn/server.crt

Path = eth0
Path = wlan0
```

### JSON config

The loader auto-detects JSON files (first non-space char is `{`).

Server example:

```json
{
    "mode": "server",
    "listen": "0.0.0.0:443",
    "subnet": "10.0.0.0/24",
    "subnet6": "fd00:abcd::/112",
    "cert_file": "/etc/mqvpn/server.crt",
    "key_file": "/etc/mqvpn/server.key",
    "auth_key": "legacy-fallback-key",
    "users": [
        { "name": "alice", "key": "alice-secret" },
        "bob:bob-secret"
    ],
    "max_clients": 64,
    "scheduler": "wlb",
    "cc": "bbr2",
    "proxy": {
        "enabled": false,
        "sni": "vpn.example.com,*.edge.example",
        "quic_fallback": "127.0.0.1:4443",
        "http2_backend": "127.0.0.1:8080",
        "http2_backend_tls": false,
        "max_connections": 64,
        "idle_timeout_sec": 60
    }
}
```

Client example:

```json
{
    "mode": "client",
    "server_addr": "203.0.113.1:443",
    "tls_server_name": "vpn.example.com",
    "auth_key": "client-key",
    "insecure": false,
    "dns": ["1.1.1.1", "8.8.8.8"],
    "paths": ["eth0", "wlan0"],
    "reconnect": true,
    "reconnect_interval": 5,
    "kill_switch": false,
    "manage_routes": false,
    "scheduler": "wlb",
    "cc": "bbr2"
}
```

Notes:
- `users` is server-side auth and accepts either objects (`{"name","key"}`) or `"name:key"` strings.
- `auth_key` remains supported as a single legacy/global key.
- `mode` is optional if it can be inferred (`listen` implies server).
- `manage_routes` defaults to `true`; set it to `false` on router/embedded integrations where an external orchestrator owns the host routing table and mqvpn should only bring up the TUN.
- **[mqvpn-prometheus-exporter](https://github.com/mp0rta/mqvpn-prometheus-exporter) requires per-user keys.** Using mqvpn-prometheus-exporter, you can correct and visualize mqvpn metrics. If you use it, sharing a single `auth_key` across
  multiple clients works for the VPN data plane, but the control API
  surfaces those sessions as `user="(global)"` and the Prometheus exporter
  cannot distinguish them — series labels collide and the scrape is
  dropped. For multi-client deployments register each client under `users`
  (or via `add_user` over the control API) so each gets a distinct `user`
  label.

```bash
sudo mqvpn --config /etc/mqvpn/server.conf
sudo mqvpn --config /etc/mqvpn/client.conf
```

## Schedulers

| Scheduler       | TCP        | UDP        | Typical use                                     |
|-----------------|------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `minrtt`        | min RTT    | min RTT    | latency-first                                   |
| `wlb` (default) | flow pin   | unpinned   | general use; UDP packets distributed per-packet |
| `wlb_udp_pin`   | flow pin   | flow pin   | each UDP connection kept on a single path       |
| `backup_fec`    | redundant  | redundant  | resilience-first (requires XQC_ENABLE_FEC)      |

**Choosing wlb vs wlb_udp_pin:** Plain `wlb` distributes UDP packets across
paths per-packet, which gives better aggregate throughput when the inner
protocol tolerates reorder. Some inner UDP protocols, however, maintain their
own packet ordering and may treat reorder as packet loss — under asymmetric-RTT
paths this can slow them down and throughput drops. `wlb_udp_pin` keeps each
UDP connection on a single path to avoid that case. If you observe degraded UDP
throughput under `wlb`, try `wlb_udp_pin`; otherwise `wlb` is the better
default.

**Trade-off note (`wlb_udp_pin`):** the xquic WLB flow table is a fixed 4096-entry
open-addressed structure with 60s idle eviction. Workloads with very high
short-flow UDP churn (e.g. high-rate DNS, mDNS bursts) may evict longer-lived
inner flows under probe-region pressure. `wlb_udp_pin` is intended for tunnels
carrying a small-to-moderate set of long-lived inner UDP flows; high-churn UDP
profiles are better served by `wlb`.

## Reorder buffer (datagram lane)

A single inner UDP/QUIC flow striped across paths with different RTTs arrives
reordered, and many inner protocols treat reorder as loss and back off. The
reorder buffer holds datagrams in a short receive-side window and releases them
in order, so one inner flow can aggregate both paths — the datagram-lane
counterpart to what the [hybrid TCP stream lane](#hybrid-mode-tcp-lane) does for
TCP. Off by default; negotiated end-to-end (both client and server must enable
it) and a no-op when either side has it off.

```ini
[Reorder]
Enabled = on
MaxWaitMs = 50           # reorder window: hold out-of-order datagrams up to this long
CapPackets = 1024        # per-flow buffer cap (packets)

# Optional: target specific inner flows with a tuned preset
[ReorderRule]
Proto = udp
Port = 443
Profile = cellular_bond  # cellular_bond (wait=50ms, cap=1024) | fiber_lte (wait=50ms, cap=2048)
```

INI/JSON only (no CLI flag). Best on asymmetric-RTT path pairs (e.g. Wi-Fi +
LTE); for symmetric, loss-dominated paths leave it off. See
[docs/report/](docs/report/) for the parameter sweep and measured numbers.

## Reinjection (speculative duplication)

Sends copies of selected packets over a second link. This costs some extra
bandwidth, and in return the tunnel rides out packet loss and sudden link
trouble much more smoothly. Off by default. Sender-side only — each side's
setting protects the traffic it *sends*, so set it on the **server** to protect
download traffic (and on the client for upload). Requires multipath with two
or more active paths — silently inactive with only one.

```ini
[Multipath]
Reinjection = off                     # off (default) | deadline | idle | dgram
ReinjectionSrttFactorPct = 110        # deadline mode: duplicate an unacked packet older than factor x min_srtt (100-1000; 110 = 1.1x)
ReinjectionHardDeadlineMs = 500       # deadline mode: upper clamp (1-60000)
ReinjectionDeadlineLowerBoundMs = 20  # deadline mode: lower clamp (1-60000; clamped down to the hard deadline if it would exceed it)
```

- `deadline` — insurance for bonded tunnels running the [hybrid TCP lane](#hybrid-mode-tcp-lane). Most of the time it does nothing and costs nothing. When a link suddenly goes bad, data already sent on it must be recovered before in-order delivery lets anything behind it through — even data that already arrived via the healthy link — which in bad cases stalls transfers for up to a second; `deadline` resends the late data on the healthy link right away, shrinking that stall to a barely noticeable blip. Protects stream (TCP-lane) traffic only — with the hybrid lane disabled its effect is limited to control streams and a warning is logged.
- `idle` — low-cost smoothing for interactive use (SSH, browsing): whenever the tunnel has nothing else to send, it uses that spare moment to send a copy of recent still-unconfirmed data over another link, shaving off occasional hiccups. No tuning needed.
- `dgram` — for tunnels dedicated to real-time traffic (VoIP, gaming): every datagram-lane packet (UDP and other non-TCP traffic; hybrid-mode TCP is not duplicated) is sent over two links at once, so a lost packet or a dying link no longer causes dropouts or lag spikes. **Uses double the bandwidth for that traffic; not recommended for mixed tunnels** — it duplicates all inner UDP, including HTTP/3 video streams, so the usable speed of the datagram lane drops to a single link's capacity. Duplicates are delivered twice at the receiver's TUN unless the [reorder buffer](#reorder-buffer-datagram-lane) is enabled (it removes them); plain UDP apps may otherwise see duplicate packets.

Per-path duplicated bytes are reported as `reinject_tx_bytes` in the control
API `get_status` response.

## Hybrid mode (TCP lane)

Optionally terminates inner TCP connections locally (embedded lwIP) and relays them over a dedicated HTTP/3 request stream instead of the datagram CONNECT-IP path — trades small per-flow overhead for multipath TCP aggregation (see docs/report/ for measured numbers).

```
TUN packet
  │
  ▼
classifier (per packet: protocol + Tcp mode + tunnel-subnet carve-out)
  │
  ├─ TCP, Tcp=stream (or Tcp=auto with ≥2 active paths)
  │     └─▶ tcp lane (client-side lwIP) ─▶ HTTP/3 request stream ─▶ server egress connect()
  ├─ UDP (parseable)
  │     └─▶ datagram lane (existing reorder/STAMP path) ─▶ CONNECT-IP DATAGRAM
  └─ everything else (incl. TCP under Tcp=raw, or Tcp=auto with <2 active paths)
        └─▶ raw lane (existing, unchanged) ─▶ CONNECT-IP DATAGRAM
```

```ini
[Hybrid]
Enabled = true
Tcp = auto              # stream | raw | auto (per-flow: TCP lane once >=2 paths are active)
TcpMaxFlows = 256        # concurrent TCP-lane flow cap (client, up to 4096) / per-session cap (server)
EgressAllow = 10.0.5.0/24  # server: punch a hole through the default-deny egress ACL
```

Disabled by default; existing users see no behavior change. See
[docs/control-api.md §9](docs/control-api.md#9-hybrid-mode-configuration-keys)
for the full `[Hybrid]` config key reference and the `get_stats` counters
this mode exposes.

## Server fallback proxy

On Linux, one mqvpn UDP listener can also front another QUIC service. The
router reads SNI from QUIC v1/v2 Initial packets without terminating the
fallback connection's TLS:

- configured SNI names stay in mqvpn; CONNECT-IP and Hybrid TCP keep their
  existing behavior, while ordinary HTTP/3 requests go to an h2c backend;
- unmatched SNI names are forwarded as raw UDP datagrams to `QuicFallback`.

The feature is disabled by default and requires both a UDP QUIC fallback and a
prior-knowledge h2c backend. `Http2BackendTLS=true` is intentionally rejected.
See [Server fallback proxy](docs/server-fallback-proxy.md) for the complete
configuration, nginx example, routing rules, security properties, and current
limitations.

## systemd

```bash
# Server
sudo cp /etc/mqvpn/server.conf.example /etc/mqvpn/server.conf
sudo vi /etc/mqvpn/server.conf   # edit cert/key paths, auth key, etc.
sudo systemctl enable --now mqvpn-server

# Client (template — instance name maps to config file)
sudo cp /etc/mqvpn/client.conf.example /etc/mqvpn/client-home.conf
sudo vi /etc/mqvpn/client-home.conf   # edit server address, auth key, etc.
sudo systemctl enable --now mqvpn-client@home
```

## Control API

A running server can be managed at runtime over a TCP port using newline-delimited JSON.

Control API: see [docs/control-api.md](docs/control-api.md) for the full wire-protocol reference (all 8 commands, request/response schemas, error strings).

### Enable

The control API is **disabled by default**. Enable it via any of the following:

#### From `install.sh`

```bash
sudo bash install.sh --enable-control            # port 9090
sudo bash install.sh --enable-control 9091
```

#### From INI (`/etc/mqvpn/server.conf`)

```ini
[Control]
Listen = 127.0.0.1:9090
```

#### From JSON (`/etc/mqvpn/server.json`)

```json
{
  "control_listen": "127.0.0.1:9090"
}
```

#### From CLI (per-field override of the config file)

```bash
sudo mqvpn --mode server ... --control-port 9090

# Bind to a specific address (default: 127.0.0.1)
sudo mqvpn --mode server ... --control-port 9090 --control-addr 127.0.0.1
```

> **Security:** bind only to `127.0.0.1` (the default) unless the port is protected by a firewall or network policy. The control API has no authentication.

### Commands

#### Add a user

```bash
echo '{"cmd":"add_user","name":"carol","key":"carol-secret"}' | nc 127.0.0.1 9090
```
```json
{"ok":true}
```

Calling `add_user` with an existing name updates the key in place.

#### Remove a user

```bash
echo '{"cmd":"remove_user","name":"carol"}' | nc 127.0.0.1 9090
```
```json
{"ok":true}
```

#### List users

```bash
echo '{"cmd":"list_users"}' | nc 127.0.0.1 9090
```
```json
{"ok":true,"users":["alice","bob"]}
```

#### Get stats

```bash
echo '{"cmd":"get_stats"}' | nc 127.0.0.1 9090
```
```json
{"ok":true,"n_clients":2,"bytes_tx":983040,"bytes_rx":458752}
```

#### Error response

```json
{"ok":false,"error":"user not found"}
```

### From code (Python example)

```python
import socket, json

def ctrl(port, cmd):
    with socket.create_connection(("127.0.0.1", port)) as s:
        s.sendall((json.dumps(cmd) + "\n").encode())
        return json.loads(s.makefile().readline())

ctrl(9090, {"cmd": "add_user",    "name": "dave", "key": "dave-secret"})
ctrl(9090, {"cmd": "remove_user", "name": "dave"})
print(ctrl(9090, {"cmd": "list_users"}))   # {'ok': True, 'users': ['alice', 'bob']}
print(ctrl(9090, {"cmd": "get_stats"}))    # {'ok': True, 'n_clients': 1, ...}
```

## Benchmarks

Asymmetric dual-path (300M/10ms + 80M/30ms) via network namespaces. Full report: [`docs/benchmarks_netns.md`](docs/benchmarks_netns.md)

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Failover | **0 downtime** |
| Bandwidth aggregation (WLB, 16 streams) | **319 Mbps** (84% of 380 Mbps theoretical) |
| WLB vs MinRTT | WLB **+21%** |

### Hybrid TCP-lane (v0.9.0)

Symmetric 2×100 Mbit / 25 ms, TCP uplink, `iperf3 -P {1,2,4,8,16}`, 3 reps. The hybrid TCP **stream lane** terminates TCP at the client and relays it in-order over a QUIC STREAM, so even a single flow aggregates both paths — where raw multipath (datagram tunneling) makes one flow back off on cross-path reorder. Hybrid ON reaches **~187 Mbps** (≈93 % of the 200 Mbps aggregate) at *every* stream count:

| WLB, streams (`-P`) | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 16 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| hybrid OFF (raw) | 96 | 177 | 167 | 177 | 178 |
| hybrid ON (lane) | **187** | 186 | 188 | 188 | 188 |
| gain | **+95 %** | +5 % | +12 % | +6 % | +6 % |

Charts: [MinRTT](bench_results/hybrid_mode/hybrid_mode_minrtt_1783350878.png) · [WLB](bench_results/hybrid_mode/hybrid_mode_wlb_1783350878.png) — bench: [`benchmarks/bench_hybrid_scheduler.sh`](benchmarks/bench_hybrid_scheduler.sh) · data: [`bench_results/hybrid_mode/`](bench_results/hybrid_mode/)

**Asymmetric paths** — same bench on the asymmetric pair (A = 300 Mbit / 10 ms + B = 80 Mbit / 30 ms, 380 Mbps aggregate). Hybrid ON saturates the aggregate (**350–356 Mbps** ≈ 93 % at `-P ≥ 2`) here too, while raw multipath never fully recovers: the cross-path reorder penalty (20 ms vs 60 ms RTT legs) caps it at 330 Mbps even at 16 streams — so unlike the symmetric case, raw multipath needs many parallel streams to close the gap:

| WLB, streams (`-P`) | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 16 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| hybrid OFF (raw) | 261 | 271 | 314 | 317 | 330 |
| hybrid ON (lane) | **327** | 350 | 354 | 356 | 354 |
| gain | **+26 %** | +29 % | +13 % | +12 % | +7 % |

### SRT live streaming

SRT contribution feeds over mqvpn, netns-emulated impaired links, mqvpn defaults (WLB, BBRv2) + SRT `lossmaxttl=32`. The starved-uplinks comparison video is shown at the top of this page; per-scenario results:

| Scenario | Direct (single link) | mqvpn (2-path) |
|---|---|---|
| Starved uplinks (8 Mbps FHD over 2 × 6 Mbit) | VMAF 8.6, 1.2 s frozen | VMAF **87.7**, 0 s frozen |
| Exceeds any single link (120 Mbps over 2 × 100 Mbit) | 31.5 % stream loss | **0.06 %** stream loss |
| Dual cellular (42 Mbps over 40 + 30 Mbit lossy links) | 20–40 % stream loss | **0.9 %** stream loss |

### RTMP live streaming

RTMP runs over a single TCP connection and cannot bond links by itself (commercial bonding products work around this with proprietary protocols and cloud-side conversion). Through mqvpn's [hybrid TCP lane](#hybrid-mode-tcp-lane) it bonds transparently — the encoder and the streaming service stay unmodified. Below, one of two bonded links is cut for 30 seconds mid-stream: direct (left) stops for ~33 s, mqvpn (right) never stops:

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04d3b4f9-be82-4a85-857d-474e503bfa94

| Scenario | Direct (single link) | mqvpn (2-path) |
|---|---|---|
| Two weak uplinks (8 Mbps over 2 × 6 Mbit) | capped at 5.7 Mbps, drifts behind live | **7.8 Mbps, stays live** |
| Bursty mobile-style loss | repeated disconnects, barely delivers | **stable, no disconnects** |
| One link cut for 30 s | stream drops until the link returns | **keeps streaming** |

## Known issues

### Post-quantum handshake behind a Retry — mitigated in xquic, not fully fixed

`X25519MLKEM768` is requested by default on both sides (`src/mqvpn_client.c`,
`src/mqvpn_server.c`). Its 1184-byte key share fills the client's first Initial packet
to `MQVPN_MAX_PKT_OUT_SIZE` (1400). The server then answers with a Retry for address
validation, and xquic rebuilds that Initial with the Retry token added to the header
while copying the payload in unchanged — pushing the packet past the AEAD output buffer
by a single byte. Encryption failed with `XQC_TLS_ENCRYPT_DATA_ERROR` (-736) and the
connection closed locally, so **no handshake could complete at all**. It surfaced as a
10-second dispatch timeout in `tests/test_tcp_egress.c`, but production clients hit the
same path.

Mitigated in the xquic fork by reserving worst-case header-growth space
([r11234567/xquic@a40cbd5](https://github.com/r11234567/xquic/commit/a40cbd5)), pinned
through `third_party/xquic`. PMTUD cannot help here: it only takes effect after the
handshake negotiates transport parameters, while the failure is in the handshake itself.

**Still open:** the re-sent Initial can exceed the configured `max_pkt_out_size`, so it
may be dropped on a path whose real MTU is that small. The proper fix is re-fragmenting
the CRYPTO data under the new header; tracked under "Known issues" in the xquic fork's
README.
